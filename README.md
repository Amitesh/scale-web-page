# Scale Web page

It is a small plugin to scale the content of given container. It has lots of different options to control the scaling of content. It is using `CSS3` `transform: scale(...)` property to scale the content.

For more details about the options check out the `scale-page.js` file.

## How to use

Here is an example:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
      var scalePage = new ScalePage({
      baseWidth: 500,
      baseHeight: 400,
      scaleBy: 'best-fit',
      containerToPosition: '.container',
      showInfo: true
  });
  scalePage.init();
});
```

## A sample Html markup

```html
<body class="scale-container">
  <div class="container"></div>
</body>
```
### TODO
- Add limit to for minimum scaling on lower screen devices. It should not scale less than the given sizes.

### Things to keep in consideration while using scaling feature 
- If you are using positions from mouse events (event.pageX or event.pageY) then it has to use the scaling factor with it.
- Drag & Drop will not going to work as per the expectation. Need to apply scale factor.
